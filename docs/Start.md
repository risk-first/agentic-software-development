# Agentic Software Development Risk Framework

A risk framework for **agentic AI software development** — addressing the unique threats that emerge when AI systems autonomously write, modify, and deploy code.

## Why This Exists

Existing AI governance frameworks like **NIST AI RMF** and **ISO/IEC 42001** focus on AI as a decision-making component. But AI is no longer just making decisions inside software — it is becoming the **primary producer and modifier** of software itself.

This shifts risk from *"bad AI decision"* to *"unsafe evolving codebase"* — a completely different class of risk that current frameworks don't address.
