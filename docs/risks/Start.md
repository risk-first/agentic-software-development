# Agentic Risks

The threats that emerge when AI agents autonomously write, modify, and deploy code. These risks are distinct from traditional AI risks (bias, hallucination) because they concern **AI as a producer of software**, not AI as a decision-making component.

## Actor Taxonomy

Risks in this framework involve four types of actors:

| Actor | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **External Attacker** | External | Adversaries who exploit, compromise, or manipulate the system |
| **AI Agent** | Internal | The agent itself exhibiting unsafe, misaligned, or careless behaviors |
| **Human Operator** | Internal | The human user/developer making configuration or approval decisions |
| **Organisational Culture** | Systemic | Organizational pressures and incentive structures that enable risk |
