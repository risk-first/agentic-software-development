# Code Generation

The ability for an AI agent to produce source code, scripts, or configuration files.

## Description

Code generation is the foundational capability of agentic software development. It encompasses the AI's ability to translate intent (expressed via prompts, requirements, or inferred context) into executable artifacts.

## Threat Surface

This capability is exploited by threats including:
- Verification Illusion
- Insecure Code Generation
- License Contamination
- Architectural Erosion

## Related Controls

- Independent Verification
- Static Analysis Gates
- Dependency Governance
