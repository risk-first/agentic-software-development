# Execution

The ability for an AI agent to execute code, scripts, or commands in a runtime environment.

## Description

Execution capability allows agents to run the code they generate or invoke, observe outputs, and iterate based on results. This enables autonomous debugging, testing, and deployment workflows.

## Threat Surface

This capability is exploited by threats including:
- Arbitrary Code Execution
- Resource Exhaustion
- Environment Contamination
- Blast Radius Expansion

## Related Controls

- Sandboxing
- Resource Limits
- Staged Deployment
- Kill Switches
